####Work with us
The FETLab is recruiting PhD students for Fall 2016! We're currently
working on a wide variety of projects in the area of improving the
ability of non-experts to use digital fabrication equipment such as 3D
printers, laser cutters, and computer-controlled milling machines.

We're looking for strongly motivated students with technical skills in
the areas of computer graphics, computer vision, mechatronics,
or robotics.
